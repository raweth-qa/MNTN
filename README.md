# MNTN
# The public api being tested == https://httpbin.org and it does have a swagger page and a full variation of method calls Get,Post,Put,Delete
  ### I will be using the https protocol (no one should use http)  this is done without a key (auth token or jwt)  
  ### but I am very familiar with these and other security protocols
  
## The code will be standalone requiring python3 and the following modules:
   - requests
   - json
   - unittest (standard package)
   - sys
   - urllib
   - inspect
   - code
   
 
## For the assessment, please choose a public API to automate and provide the following:
 	- Executable automation you have written to verify the public API 
  == please run the following in shell (or windows.cmd) python3 /Users/rweth/keystone_qa/Scripts/httpbin_basic.py
 	- Explanation of your approach
  
 	- Pros and cons of approach
